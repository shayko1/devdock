## Pull Request Guidelines

- Fill out the PR template.
- Keep PRs small and focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Include tests for new functionality when possible.
- Make sure all existing tests pass (`npm test`).
- Update documentation if your change affects user-facing behavior.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── main/           # Electron main process (Node.js)
├── preload/        # Preload scripts (IPC bridge)
├── renderer/       # React UI (components, hooks)
└── shared/         # Shared types between main & renderer
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript throughout — no `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Functional React components with hooks.
- No unnecessary comments — code should be self-documenting.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an [issue](https://github.com/shayko1/devdock/issues) with:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- macOS version and DevDock version
