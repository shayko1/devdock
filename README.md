## Why DevDock?

Most developers juggle a dozen tools just to keep their projects running: one terminal here, a browser tab there, an IDE somewhere else, and a half-forgotten `localhost:3000` that is still bound to a dead process. DevDock replaces that chaos with a single window.

- **See everything at a glance** — every project, its status, port, and tech stack on one screen
- **Run Claude sessions with real terminals** — not a chat widget, a full `zsh` shell with `node-pty` and `xterm.js`
- **Control a browser from the command line** — navigate, screenshot, click, and type through a `browser` CLI injected into every session
- **Automate with agents** — discover and manage your scheduled Claude-powered scripts and LaunchAgents
- **Stay in flow** — keyboard-first navigation, session persistence, git worktrees, and one-click IDE launching

---

## Features

### Launchpad

Scan any directory and instantly see every project as a card. Each card shows the detected tech stack, custom tags, configured port, and live status. Start, stop, view logs, and open in your favorite editor — all without leaving DevDock.

</div>
</details>

**Highlights:**
- Auto-detects tech stack from `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, and more
- Filter by tags, running status, or free-text search (`Cmd+K`)
- Detects externally running ports so you never wonder "is this already up?"
- Bulk select, hide, or remove projects
- One-click open in **Cursor**, **Zed**, **Terminal**, or **Finder**

### All Folders

Browse every folder in your workspace with git branch info, remote status, and modification time. Hover any row to reveal quick-launch buttons for Claude, Cursor, Zed, Terminal, and Finder.

### Claude Sessions

Embedded terminal sessions running the Claude CLI inside a real shell. Each session gets its own git worktree for isolated development and can be resumed at any time.

**What makes this different from a plain terminal:**

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Chat input bar** | Cursor-style input with `@` file mentions, `/` slash commands, model & effort selectors, image upload, and context usage tracking |
| **Session history** | Browse, search, and resume past conversations with auto-generated titles and keyword tags — keeps 6 months of history |
| **Auto-recap on resume** | Resuming a session automatically asks Claude to summarize what happened so you can pick up where you left off |
| **Git worktrees** | Every session gets an isolated branch — no conflicts with your main work. Worktree sessions resume into the correct directory |
| **File explorer & search** | Browse project files and search content in a unified side panel |
| **Diff viewer** | Review all changes Claude made before committing |
| **MCP & Skills panel** | View and manage MCP servers, skills, and custom commands |
| **Browser panel** | View web pages inline without switching windows |
| **Pipeline** | Autonomous task execution: plan → implement → validate → review |
| **Prompt Coach** | Context-aware suggestions to get better results from Claude (uses OpenAI, configurable) |

---

### Agents

Automatically discovers Claude-powered agents from `~/.claude/scripts` and macOS LaunchAgents. View schedules, live status, cost tracking, and output logs. Trigger any agent manually with one click.

</details>

### Browser Bridge

DevDock injects a `browser` CLI command into every Claude session. This gives Claude (or you) direct control over a real browser window — no Puppeteer setup, no boilerplate.

```bash
browser navigate https://localhost:3000    # open a page
browser screenshot                         # capture what's on screen
browser click '#submit-btn'                # click an element
browser type '#email' hello@test.com       # type into an input
browser text                               # get visible page text
browser evaluate 'document.title'          # run arbitrary JS
```

The browser window persists across commands and works with any local or remote URL. Screenshots are saved to disk so Claude can reference them.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | 10.15 Catalina |
| **Node.js** | 18+ |
| **git** | any recent version |
| **Claude CLI** | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| **Xcode CLI Tools** | `xcode-select --install` (for native `node-pty` build) |

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/devdock.git
cd devdock

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
npm run dev
```

### Build & Package

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Package as macOS .app
npm run package

# Install to Applications
cp -R dist/DevDock.app /Applications/
```

---

## First-Time Setup

1. **Install Claude CLI** if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Set your workspace path** in the Launchpad tab (defaults to `~/Workspace`). DevDock scans this directory to discover projects.

3. **Click Scan** to populate the project grid. Projects are detected by the presence of `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, and similar manifest files.

4. **Optional — add agents** by placing scripts in `~/.claude/scripts` or configuring macOS LaunchAgents. DevDock discovers and lists them automatically.

# Development with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>node-pty fails to build</strong></summary>

`node-pty` requires native compilation. Install Xcode Command Line Tools and reinstall:

```bash
xcode-select --install
npm install
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude CLI not found</strong></summary>

Ensure Claude is installed globally and on your PATH:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
which claude
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Port already in use</strong></summary>

DevDock detects port conflicts automatically. Check the project card status indicator and stop the conflicting process or change the port in the edit modal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Browser bridge not working</strong></summary>

The `browser` command is only available inside Claude sessions started from the Claude tab. Ensure you're in a DevDock-managed session where the PATH has been configured.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sessions not resuming</strong></summary>

Active sessions are tracked in `~/.devdock/active-sessions.json` and auto-resume on restart. Session history is read from Claude Code's own files in `~/.claude/projects/`. Ensure both paths are writable and not being cleared by cleanup tools.
</details>
